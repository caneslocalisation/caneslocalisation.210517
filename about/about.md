<h5> The workshop </h5>
<sup><sub> This workshop was developed by students with a diverse set of interests in state-of-the-art problems in quantum and statistical physics. The unifying concept between their research topics was localisation, and it's applications in modelling quantum systems. Please read our extended workshop rationale [here](www.jeff.com). This workshop is organised with support from CANES, the EPSRC, Overleaf and King's College London.

<h5>  CANES </h5>
<sup><sub> [CANES](http://www.kcl.ac.uk/innovation/groups/noneqsys/About-Us/Overview.aspx) is the EPSRC doctoral training centre for Cross-Dispiclinary Approaches to Non-Equilibrium Systems, based at King's College London. It aims to provide training in, and to study, non-equilibrium phenomenon in a broad range of subjects. This focusses on using theoretical modelling, data analysis and simulation techniques, and is applied to topics such as networks, finance, landscape change and protein folding.      </sub></sup>
