<sub> This event is hosted at the Strand Building of [King's College London](http://www.kcl.ac.uk/index.aspx). <br />  This campus is in central London and we recommend that visitors take the opportunity to visit local sites. On a related note, accommodation can be expensive and should be booked well in advance. The university is well connected by tube stations (Temple and Covent Garden) which extend the feasible accommodation range significantly. </sub>
